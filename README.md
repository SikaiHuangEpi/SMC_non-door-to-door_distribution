# SMC Door-to-door vs. Non-door-to-door visit
Predictors of accessing seasonal malaria chemoprevention medicines through non-door-to-door distribution in Nigeria
# Abstract
Background
In Nigeria, seasonal malaria chemoprevention (SMC) is typically administered door-to-door to children under five by community medicine distributors during high transmission seasons. While door-to-door distribution (DDD) is exclusively employed in Nigeria as part of standard operating procedures of SMC programmes, some households access SMC through non-DDD channels, such as fixed-point distributions, health facilities, and private purchase. However, analysis of access to SMC medicines through non-DDD has been limited, with little evidence of its outcomes on adherence to the three-day complete course of SMC medicines and caregiver actions in the event of adverse reactions to SMC medicines.

Methods
Data were obtained from SMC end-of-round coverage surveys conducted in Nigeria in 2021 and 2022, including 25,278 households for the analysis. The proportion of households accessing SMC medicine through non-DDD and the distribution of various non-DDD sources of SMC medicines were described. Multivariate random-effects logistic regression models were performed to identify predictors of accessing SMC medicines through non-DDD. The associations between non-DDD, and caregiver-reporting of adherence to complete administration of SMC medicines and caregiver actions in the event of adverse reactions to SMC medicines were also assessed.

Results
Less than 2% (314/24003) of households accessed SMC medicines through non-DDD in the states surveyed. Over 60% of non-DDD access was via health facility personnel and community medicine distributors from different locations. Variables associated with non-DDD access included heads of household being born in the local state (OR = 0.68, 95% CI 0.47 to 0.90), households residing in the study state since the first cycle of the SMC round (OR = 0.39, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.88), households with high wealth index (OR = 1.36, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.82), and caregivers hearing about date of SMC delivery in the previous cycle (OR = 0.18, 95%CI 0.14 to 0.24). Furthermore, non-DDD was associated with reduced SMC adherence and higher caregiver non-reporting of adverse reactions to SMC medicines in children compared with DDD.

Conclusion
This study provides evidence on the characteristics of households accessing SMC medicines through non-DDD and its potential negative outcomes on adherence to SMC medicine and adverse reaction reporting, underscoring potential implementation issues that may arise if non-DDD delivery models are adopted in SMC, particularly in places where DDD had been firstly used.
